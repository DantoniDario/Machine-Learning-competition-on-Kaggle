Kaggle Competition about conversion prediction.

A major tech company wants to assess the quality of an online ads campaign. 
Online users are the target of this campaign. The users see a web banner during their browsing activity. 
For each user, we want to predict whether a "conversion" occurs. A conversion is when a user clicks on the banner and then subscribes to the service.

I attached a first attempt of stacking method. Here I tried to combine a random forest, an Extreme Gradient Boosting and a neural network using a logistic model with ridge penalisation term.
